# Module 6 Assignment

This project is a demonstration of the use of python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to perform the following weather calculations:

# Part 1: WeatherPy
  In WeatherPy.ipynb contains this section which uses python script to make requests through the OpenWeatherMap API to gather data, and then using citipy Pthon library to create the following graphs with analysis.
  # Scatter Plots
 - Relationship between Latitude vs. Temperature
 - Relationship between Latitude vs. Humidity
 - Relationship between Latitude vs. Cloudiness
 - Relationship between Latitude vs. Wind Speed

 # Linear Regression Plots for Northern and Southern Hemispheres 
 - Correlation between Temperature (C) and Latitude 
 - Correlation between Humidity and Latitude
 - Correlation between Cloudiness and Latitude
 - Correlation between Wind Speed and Latitude 
 

# Part 2: VacationPy
Incomplete - demonstrates using the Geoapify API to create a map showing the size of humidity for every city within the data 

# Resources
The following are resources and links used to help with the creation of these scripts
 -  Used provided sample solution "WeatherPY.ipynb" and "VacationPy.ipynb to build and organize results, copying format and notes to help develop solutions
 -  Class recordings and posted answers to previous homework were used to help determine paths toward solutions
 -  Linear Regression code was based off of answers in Module 5 as well as map code and plots were based off of Module 6 solutions

# Additional Help 
TA assistances after class provided assistance for inquiries and hiccups in code
