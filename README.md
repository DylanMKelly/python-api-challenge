# Module 6 Assignment

This project is a demonstration of the use of python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to perform the following weather calculations:

# Part 1: WeatherPy
  Description
  # Scatter Plots
 - Merging of two csv files (Mouse_metadata.csv, Study_results.csv) into one single DataFrame
 - Number of mice within merged data
 - Identifying duplicate mice found through Mouse ID and Timepoint data
 - Cleaned DataFrame excluding duplicate mice
 - Number of mice in cleaned merged data
   # Linear Regression Plots
 - Merging of two csv files (Mouse_metadata.csv, Study_results.csv) into one single DataFrame
 - Number of mice within merged data
 - Identifying duplicate mice found through Mouse ID and Timepoint data
 - Cleaned DataFrame excluding duplicate mice
 - Number of mice in cleaned merged data

# Part 2: VacationPy
Calculations using groupby function categoized by Drug Regimens showing the following:
  - The mean of the tumor volume 
  - The median of the tumor volume 
  - The variance of the tumor volume  
  - The standard deviation of the tumor volume 
  - The SEM of the tumor volume  
  - A DataFrame created with the new summary statistics

# Resources
The following are resources and links used to help with the creation of these scripts
 -  Used provided sample solution "pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb" to build and organize results, copying format and notes to help develop solutions
 -  Class recordings and posted answers to previous homework were used to help determine paths toward solutions, specifically outliers
